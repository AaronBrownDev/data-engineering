## Purpose

This repository documents my journey learning data engineering. It serves as a collection of projects, code examples, and resources as I progress from fundamentals to more advanced concepts in building data systems and pipelines.

## Skills Development

Through this repository, I'm focusing on developing these core data engineering skills:

### Programming Languages
- **Python**: For data processing, ETL pipelines, and analysis
- **Go (Golang)**: For building efficient, concurrent data services
- **SQL**: For database operations and optimization
- **Scala**: For big data processing (future)

### Data Technologies & Concepts
- **Data Pipeline Development**: Building ETL/ELT processes
- **Data Warehousing**: Dimensional modeling and analytics structures
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS, GCP, Azure deployment
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time data handling with Kafka
- **Data Orchestration**: Workflow management with Airflow
- **Data Governance**: Metadata management and quality controls
